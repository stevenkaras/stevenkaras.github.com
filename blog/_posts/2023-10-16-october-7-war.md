title: October 7th War

In September, I made a decision to finally publish many blog posts I have drafted over the years and focus on polishing them to be ready to publish rather than writing new content.
I used some PTO to prepare over 10 posts and will publish them eventually, however that will not be happening anytime soon.
On October 7th, Hamas launched a large-scale terrorist attack on Israeli civilians living along the Gaza border.
They murdered over 1,300 civilians and committed atrocities while abducting over 200 women, children, and elderly to the Gaza Strip where they are being held as hostages.

I personally knew several of those who were murdered and many of my friends have lost family members.
In the days since my home has come under multiple rocket attacks daily, causing stress and difficulty in explaining the sensitive situation to my children.
This pales in comparison with the pain suffered by unarmed civilians intentionally targeted for murder by terrorists and in tribute to those victims, here's a black rectangle.
It's not enough, it will never be enough. But it's the least I can do.

Posts will continue after the war is over.
