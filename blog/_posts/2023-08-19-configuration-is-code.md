Configuration is code!

That means you should:

1. Version control it
2. Review changes to it
3. Use a Realâ„¢ programming language for it
4. Comment it

Or else...you'll not get wonderful things like:

* Short and concise config files
* Type checking and linter support out of the box
* Change auditing and easy regulatory compliance
* The ability to generate complicated configurations using code

I tried writing more about this and ended up deleting around 1000 words worth of useless content.
The simplicity of this message needs to be emphasized:
